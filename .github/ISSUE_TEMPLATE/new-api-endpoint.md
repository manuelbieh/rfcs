# Motivation

<!--
Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted,
the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words,
enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too
closely to the solution you have in mind.
-->

# Detailed design

<!--
This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for consumers and implementors to understand what and how it needs to be implemented. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be defined here.
